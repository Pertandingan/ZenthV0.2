      <h2>The Story of Zenth</h2>
      <p>
        Zenth is a secret language devised centuries ago by a group of scholars from the hidden city of <strong>Vethara</strong>.
        Its glyphs were designed to be unreadable to outsiders, carrying meaning only to those who mastered the script.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally used to encode messages, Zenth evolved into a fully transliterable alphabet, capable of writing any known language
        in a single, elegant system. Scholars say Zenth can reveal hidden patterns in ordinary words if studied closely.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this project, Zenth has been reborn as a digital cipher — a playful homage to its mysterious origins,
        allowing anyone to write in an alien-looking script while keeping the text reversible for those who know its secrets.
