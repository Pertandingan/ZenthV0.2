    <h2>About Zenth</h2>
    <p>Zenth is a secret language invented in 2026 by a lone linguist from an unknown realm. Its glyphs are designed to obscure any meaning from outsiders, yet remain fully reversible. Originally developed for private writing, it now serves as a universal transliteration system for any language.</p>
    <p>The alphabet is inspired by ancient scripts but designed to be entirely unique. It can transliterate English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, and many other languages into Zenth glyphs while remaining reversible.</p>
